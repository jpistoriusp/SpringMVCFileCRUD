## My Spring MVC CRUD Project

#### What is the project?
This is my project for week 8 in Skill Distillery. It is a CRUD application of a movie database. This project showcases my current skills in the Spring framework and MVC modeling. The application reads in movies from a csv file with data such as movie year and genre. Upon startup, the user is presented with 4 options: to display the list of movies, to add a movie title, to remove an existing movie, and to generate a random movie.  

#### What future feature sets would I like to add?
I would like to implement additional data such as director name and filming location into the list of movies. I would like to use Google Maps API to display a filming location to the user upon clicking a movie title. Filtering the movies by genre, director, or title are plans I have for the project as well.

#### What stumbling points did I encounter during production?
I took time this project to educate myself with more advanced css skills. Allowing the background image to loop vertically to cover the entire list of movies took a fair amount of my time.
