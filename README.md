## My Spring MVC CRUD Project

#### What is the project?
This is my project for week 8 in Skill Distillery. It is a CRUD application of a movie database. This project showcases my current skills in the Spring framework and MVC modeling. The application reads in movies from a csv file with data such as movie year and genre. Upon startup, the user is presented with 4 options: to display the list of movies, to add a movie title, to remove an existing movie, and to generate a random movie.  

#### What future feature sets would I like to add?
Each movie has an attached id number that is based on when it was added to the list. This will allow for future capability of sorting by recently added. I would also like to implement additional data such as director name and filming location into the list of movies. I would like to use Google Maps API to display a filming location to the user upon clicking a movie title.

#### What stumbling points did I encounter during production?
I took time this project to educate myself with more advanced css skills. Allowing the background image to display at an appropriate resolution and at a fixed location took some time.
